I like to select the entire chart and limit to 5 rows to get a visual of what the chart looks like before querying the data. 
--How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT * FROM JanSales LIMIT 5; 

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND Product='iPhone'
;
--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT * FROM FebSales LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 5;

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;
--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT * FROM JanSales LIMIT 5;

SELECT MIN(price), Product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY price;
--another way of finding the same answer
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT * FROM FebSales LIMIT 5;
SELECT SUM(Quantity)*price as revenue, product, Quantity
FROM FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
ORDER BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT * FROM FebSales LIMIT 5;
SELECT count(distinct acctnum), AVG(quantity*price)
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON FebSales.orderID=customers.order_id
WHERE FebSales.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT * FROM FebSales LIMIT 5;

SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)
FROM FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

--Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive?
SELECT * FROM JanSales LIMIT 5;

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%NY%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID)>2

--How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity) as quantity
FROM FebSales
Where Product like '%Headphones%'
GROUP BY Product\
;

--What was the average amount spent per account in February? 
SELECT * FROM FebSales LIMIT 5;
SELECT * FROM customers Limit 5;

SELECT AVG(price*Quantity)
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers 
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT sum(quantity)/count(acctnum)
FROM FebSales
LEFT JOIN customers
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT * FROM JanSales LIMIT 5;

SELECT product, Sum(Quantity*Price) as Revenue 
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY Revenue desc
LIMIT 1;
