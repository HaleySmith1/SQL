#The following are questions regarding a large set of data based on media purchases. 
#This data set is the final SQL project from the Breaking Into Tech certification course. 
#Below is how I analyzed the Media Data set. 

--#1 What customers (full name, ID, and country) are not in the US. 
SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, customers.Country, customers.CustomerId
FROM customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

--#2 What customers are from Brazil? 
SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName
FROM customers
WHERE Country ='Brazil'

--#3 Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
--Include full name, Invoice ID, Date of invoice, and billing country.
SELECT * FROM Customers
SELECT * FROM Invoices

SELECT Invoices.InvoiceId, Invoices.InvoiceDate, Invoices.BillingCountry, Customers.FirstName
, Customers.LastName
FROM Invoices
LEFT JOIN Customers
ON Invoices.CustomerId=Customers.CustomerId
WHERE Customers.Country='Brazil'


--#4 Show the employees who are Sales Agents. 
SELECT * FROM employees

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title

--#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table. 
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry 
FROM Invoices;

--#6 What invoices are associated with each sales agent? 
--Include Sales Agent's full name. 
--I had to Query a couple of the tables to know which tables I exactly needed to query and how to inner join the tables needed to answer this question.
SELECT * FROM Invoices
SELECT * FROM employees
SELECT * FROM invoice_items
SELECT * FROM customers

SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId
FROM ((employees 
INNER JOIN customers ON customers.SupportRepId=employees.EmployeeId)

--#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers. 
SELECT customers.FirstName C_FirstName
, Customers.LastName C_LastName
, employees.FirstName SA_FirstName
, employees.LastName  SA_LastName

INNER JOIN customers ON customers.SupportRepId=employees.EmployeeId)
INNER JOIN invoices ON invoices.CustomerId=customers.CustomerId)

--#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT * FROM invoices;

SELECT count(invoices.InvoiceId) AS Total_Invoice_2009

--#9 What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT * FROM invoices;

--#13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT employees.LastName AS Sales_Agent, ROUND(SUM(invoices.Total), 2) AS Total_Sales 
FROM employees
INNER JOIN customers ON customers.SupportRepId=employees.EmployeeId
INNER JOIN invoices ON invoices.CustomerId=customers.CustomerId
